A GitHub Action that runs [malcontent](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent) on PR diffs to detect security changes between versions.

## Features

- üîç **Diff Analysis**: Compares malcontent findings between base and head commits
- üìä **Risk Scoring**: Calculates risk scores and detects increases
- üí¨ **PR Comments**: Automatically comments findings on pull requests
- üìù **Workflow Summary**: Outputs to GitHub Actions summary for non-PR contexts
- üéØ **Flexible Modes**: Supports both `diff` and `analyze` modes
- üìÅ **Path Filtering**: Can analyze specific directories with `base-path`

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `github-token` | GitHub token for API access | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `mode` | Analysis mode: `diff` or `analyze` | `diff` |
| `base-path` | Base directory to analyze | `.` |
| `malcontent-version` | Version of malcontent to use | `latest` |
| `fail-on-increase` | Fail if risk score increases | `true` |
| `comment-on-pr` | Comment results on PR | `true` |
| `base-ref` | Base ref to compare (auto-detected) | - |
| `head-ref` | Head ref to analyze (auto-detected) | - |

## Modes

### Diff Mode (Default)
Uses malcontent's native `diff` command to compare base and head versions. This is the most efficient method.

### Analyze Mode
Only analyzes the head version without comparison. Useful for:
- Initial security scans
- When there's no base version to compare
- Quick security checks

## Building
